### HELP US TRANSOFRM THE US ELECTRIC GRID!

In order to move to [Net-Zero by 2050](https://www.energy.gov/articles/how-were-moving-net-zero-2050) the US electric grid needs to connect thousands of GigaWatts of solar, wind and storage projects. Before that happens, power utilities have to determine if each project requires new transmission equipment or other costly infrastructure upgrades. Promising projects are currently held up in **Interconnection Queues**. The average wait time for Interconnection Queues has [increased dramatically](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/grid-interconnection-queue-berkeley-lab-lbnl-watt-coalition-wind-solar-renewables/647287/), from 18 months to seven years, since 2021.

**There are multiple thousands of GigaWatts in carbon neutral projects and billions of dollars in capital being held up from deployment.**

*This hack will attempt to bring forward ideas and concepts for how cloud technologies and AI can help drive grid transparency, increase collaboration and ultimately shorten time to interconnection*. 

If successful, we could conceptualize a collaborative space for efficient interconnection planning on the Microsoft platform and attract RPOs/ISOs, utilities and developers onto the platform.

We will focus on:
1. designing a more collaborative and open application process between developers and utilities
2. conceptualizing and MVP how ML and AI will help accelerate the initial submission reviews
3. review the way storage projects (that can export and import into a grid) could be better simulated


Prior to Global Hack we are working on:
- Finding industry experts from [IREC's BATRIES](https://www.irecusa.org/programs/batries-storage-interconnection/) project, a [local storage developer](https://granitesourcepower.energy/) and an ISO/RPO or utility company.
- Building a mini-curriculum for Microsoftees on the current grid transformation challenges and processes.
- Getting access to grid datasets that are used to determine interconnection upgrade costs
