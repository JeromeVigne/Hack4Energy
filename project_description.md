### HELP US TRANSOFRM THE US ELECTRIC GRID!

In order to reach the ambitious carbon goals accross the US, solar, wind and storage projects will need to be connected to the grid rapidly in the coming years. Before that happens, utilities have to perform rigorous impact studies that establish if new transmission equipment or other upgrades are needed in order to connect each project. These project are queued up in "interconnection queues". These queues are [dramatically increasing](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/grid-interconnection-queue-berkeley-lab-lbnl-watt-coalition-wind-solar-renewables/647287/), having gone from 18 months to over 7 years. 

**There are multiple thousands GW of carbon neutral projects and billions of dollars in capital held up from deployment today.**

*This hack will attempt to bring forward ideas and concepts for how cloud technologies can help shorten the interconnection review process and drive grid transparency*. 

If successful, we could conceptualize a collaborative space for efficient interconnection planning on the Microsoft platform and attract RPOs/ISOs, Utilities and developers onto the platform.

We will focus on:
1. designing a more collaborative and open application process between developers and utilities
2. conceptualizing and MVP how ML and AI could help accelerate the initial submission reviews
3. review the way impact of storage project (that can export and import into a grid) could be better simulated


Prior to Global Hack we are working on:
- Finding industry experts from [IREC's BATRIES](https://www.irecusa.org/programs/batries-storage-interconnection/) project, a [local storage developer](https://granitesourcepower.energy/) and an ISO/RPO or utility company.
- Building a mini-curriculum for Microsoftees on the current grid transformation challenges and processes.
- Getting access to grid datasets that are used to determine interconnection upgrade costs
